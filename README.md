# Nearby-Create

Welcome to Nearby-Create! This project aims to provide a script for users to
generate an SQLite3 database targetted at discovering public transport
facilities nearby geographic coordinates in France.

It actually works for the MÃ©tropole Rouen Normandie region but can be adapted
to suit any french region.

In order to do so, it uses `transport.data.gouv.fr`, a french government
website pointing to open data.

## Getting Started

To get started with Nearby-Create, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Zigazou/nearby-create.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nearby-create`
3. Create the database: `python3 nearby-create-database.py transport.db`

Note: if the database already exists, it will delete and recreate it!

## Features

- The script queries the `transport.data.gouv.fr` site to find files to
  download.
- Names are corrected to allow a better user experience.
- A three character prefix is added to each identifier thus allowing having
  multiplce sources in the same tables.
- Data not needed for finding transport facilities are wiped from the database.

The database structure is given by the `nearby-create-database.db.dia`.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Requests
